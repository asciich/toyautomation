# servo_and_sersors Arduino project

Allows to set several servo postitions as well as reading digital servos.

## Getting started

* Connect your transmitter module (see Schematics below).
* Upload the project [servo_and_sersors.ino](servo_and_sersors.ino) to your development board
* Connect a serial terminal and send a "h" which gives a overview of all commands including setting channel values.

## Schematics

Not ready yet, sorry.

## Digital sensors

* For Brio trian detection I use a [light sensor](https://www.banggood.com/5V3_3V-3-Pin-Photosensitive-Sensor-Module-Light-Sensing-Resistor-Module-p-1387573.html?cur_warehouse=CN) mounted to a [3d printed rail](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4139498).
